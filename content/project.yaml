  description: As a young bloke with an immense interest in information technology, I enrolled at the University of Lithan to pursue a career in the web/application development industry. Combined with the experience I had and my endless exploration into the heart of technology, I wanted to learn more and took a gap to utilize it. In that brief period, I was able to successfully launch and develop an entire project . With all the wondering of whatâ€™s going to be next, the journey awaits.
