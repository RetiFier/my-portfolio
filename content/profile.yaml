  about: |
    As a young bloke with immense interest in Information Technology, enrolled in university of Lithan to pursue a career in web/application development industry. Combined with the experience I had and my endless exploration into the heart of technologies, I wanted to learn more and took a gap and utilize it. In that brief period, I was able to successfully launch and develop an entire project . With all the wondering of whatâ€™s going to be next, the journey awaits.
